Latest development builds with the newest features, bug fixes (...I mean bug introductions) can be found on the [Development Branch](https://github.com/SM64-STROOP/STROOP/tree/Development). Likewise, Stroop.exe can be found under (Windows Build) and ran.

  * Windows 10 / Windows 8.1 / Windows 7 64-bit or 32-bit
  * OpenGL 3.0 or greater (3.0 requirement for map tab, 1.0 requirement for model tab only)

## Status 
  
  Stroop is currently under a development phase, however, pre-releases have been made. Current priorities include various new features and high-priority bug fixes. Prior Release 1.0, minor bug fixes will be addressed, and after code cleanup will be focused on.
 
## Building

Requirements:
  * Visual Studio *(2017 recommended)*
  * OpenTK 1.1 *(Version 1.1.1589.5942 used, others may work)*
  
Before building Stroop, OpenTK is a prerequisite. This is easiest installed by using the NuGet package manager. Stroop can be easily build from the source code by opening up the solution file in Visual Studio and performing a build.
